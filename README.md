Manage your server's weather rotation as you prefer

The plugin is divided into two phases:

Phase 1 - Weather Change Roll
Here, it is decided whether the current weather should change or not.

Phase 2 - To Which Weather Change
Here, it is decided which weather type the worlds should be set to.

In the config, you can choose which worlds the plugin affects, the percentage for phase 1, and the percentages for phase 2 based on the weather type (this means you can set different percentages for clear, rain, or thunder).

For example, you could decide to trigger phase 1 every 5 minutes with a 50% chance for the weather to change and a 50% chance for it to stay the same. If the weather change is triggered, you can then set that, if the current weather is clear, there is a 40% chance it will become rain and a 60% chance it will become thunder. Every combination is valid!
